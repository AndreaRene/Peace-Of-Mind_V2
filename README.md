<p style="color:blue">Peace of Mind is a website that will allow anyone with a need to connect to others regarding mental health and support. We provide a safe space for everyone to discuss their feelings without fear of retaliation.*</p>

## Sign up for Peace of Mind so you can...

- Make new posts called **Feelings** that others can read.  But don't worry! All posts are made using a randomly generated name so you can post with **true** freedom to express yourself.
- Comment on other user's **Feelings** so that you can provide support and emotion comfort to others who may need it.
- Provide **Hugs** to other people on their **Feelings** and comments. Think of **Hugs** as a "Like" on Facebook, but **Hugs** are more meaningful and feel better!
- Keep track of how many **Hugs** your **Feelings** have received and see a running total on your own personal Dashboard!
- Use Peace of Mind on all of your internet connected devices. Peace of Mind has been created and maintained using a fully responsive framework. We encourage you to use Peace of Mind on the stay, on the go, and everywhere life takes you.

## Installation

While Peace of mind was developed to use on a deployed website, you can certainly clone the repo. You will need to install the npm packages (npm i) and source the database in mysql(SOURCE db/schema.sql). Then you'll want to exit mysql(exit) run the seeds(npm run seed) before starting the server.
