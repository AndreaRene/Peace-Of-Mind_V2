## Sign up for Peace of Mind so you can...

Make new posts called **Feelings** that others can read.  But don't worry! All posts are made using a randomly generated name so you can post with **true** freedom to express yourself.

Comment on other user's **Feelings** so that you can provide support and emotion comfort to others who may need it.

Provide **Hugs** to other people on their **Feelings** and comments. Think of **Hugs** as a "Like" on Facebook, but **Hugs** are more meaningful and feel better!

Keep track of how many **Hugs** your **Feelings** have received and see a running total on your own personal Dashboard!

Use Peace of Mind on all of your internet connected devices. Peace of Mind has been created and maintained using a fully responsive framework. We encourage you to use Peace of Mind on the stay, on the go, and everywhere life takes you.
